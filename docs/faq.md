## Time Zones

### How do I find out what time zone I'm in?
You can click [here](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker/) to find out that timee zone you're in. That site automatically detects and recommends what time zone you should use. Alternatively, you can select your own time zone by clicking on a location on the map.

### Why is the time Titan is using one hour off?
The most likely reason for the time to be an hour off is that the time zone chosen for the user or the server was incorrect. The most likey culprit would be the use of the time zones EST, CST, MST, PST, or other similarly named time zones since those time zones are always in standard time and do not change for daylight savings time. You can click [here](https://kevinnovak.github.io/Time-Zone-Picker/) to select a more appropriate time zone from a map. Alternatively, there could be a bug in Titan that needs to be reported. If you have double checked your time zone and the issue persists, please fill out the bug report form [here](https://whix100.github.io/r/titanbug.html) and provide as much detail as you can.

## Profiles

### Why is Titan using the wrong pronoun in its response?
Titan chooses which pronoun to used based on the order that you inputted the pronouns in. When selecting your pronouns, you need to put the pronouns in the format of Subjective/Objective/Possessive. This means He/Him/His, She/Her/Hers, They/Them/Their, etc. If your pronouns are not inputted in that order, then Titan will chooses the wrong pronoun in it's response. Titan also uses the first pronoun set you give it, so if there's a pronoun that you would prefer Titan to use, assign that pronoun first. If you have checked that your pronouns are in the correct format and the issue persists, please fill out the bug report form [here](https://whix100.github.io/r/titanbug.html) and provide as much detail as you can.
